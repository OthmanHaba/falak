 * Callers that allow private networks (a self-hosted Vault, a MinIO on the LAN) may also reach private, loopback
 * and CGNAT ranges. Link-local and cloud metadata addresses (169.254.169.254 and friends) are refused always,
 * including when embedded in an IPv6 address; numeric hosts other than a dotted quad are refused.
 *
 * Check when an endpoint is saved and before every request; pin the request to the addresses returned by
 * {@see check()}, so a DNS answer that changes in between (rebinding) can't redirect it.
